# CV Project

## React exercise from The Odin Project

**Goal**: In this assignment, I learn how to structure a simple React webpage using states and props.
The end goal is to have an online CV with editable fields.
Each component should function independently with persistent state.

**Challenges**: Structuring state; accessing parent state through props; editing states that involve nested objects. This project was also a good opportunity to practice Array methods in Javascript (map, filter), object/array destructuring, and spread syntax.

Optionally, I will try to add Local Storage and explore how the finished CV can be exported to pdf.
