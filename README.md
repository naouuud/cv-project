# CV Project

## React exercise from The Odin Project

**Goal**: In this assignment, I learn how to structure a simple React webpage using states and props.
The end goal is to have an online CV with editable fields.
Each component should function independently with persistent state.

**Project challenges**: Structuring state; accessing parent state through props; editing states that involve nested objects. This project was also a good opportunity to practice Array methods in Javascript (map, filter), object/array destructuring, and spread syntax.

**Moving forward**: Ways to build upon the current project include:

- Adding Local Storage
- Export finished CV to pdf
- Create separate input and output screens. With this feature, the output CV can be styled in different ways without necessitating a re-work of the input forms.
